# PRAISys
PRAISys stands for Probabilistic Resilience Assessment of Interdependent Systems. It is a computational platform for performing the resilience analysis of interdependent systems under a given hazard scenario in a probabilistic way. It consists of five computational steps: reading input data (Step 1), damage assessment (Step 2), restoration planning (Step 3), recovery simulation (Step 4), and resilience assessment (Step 5). PRAISys implements two features with rigorous models: uncertainty quantification and interdependency modeling. Uncertainties considered are related to damage assessment (Step 2) and restoration simulation (Step 4), interdependencies considered are related to hazard (Step 1), damage (Step 2), resotration (Step 3 and Step 4), and functionality (Step 4). This platform is mainly developed in MATLAB (version R2019a or newer), with a graphical user interface. For using comprehensive features of PRAISys, Gurobi and yalmip are also required in order to properly use optimization-related modules in Step 3 and Step 4.
